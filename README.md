# Balungpisah — Landing Page

This repository contains the **public landing page and initial issue intake website** for the **Balungpisah** platform.

Balungpisah is a civic initiative designed to surface real, everyday problems from citizens and make government accountability **visible, traceable, and citizen‑defined**.

This repository is **intentionally limited in scope**. It exists to explain the idea clearly and to accept **initial reports from visitors via a simple form**.

---

## 🧭 Purpose & Philosophy

Balungpisah is built on a clear separation of roles:

* **Citizens** define problems, add facts, and decide when an issue is resolved
* **Government institutions** report actions and progress — and nothing more

> **Government reports progress. Citizens decide resolution.**

There is no automatic closure, no scoring, and no gamification. Problems remain open until people affected by them consider them solved.

This landing page exists to:

* Communicate this philosophy in plain language
* Lower the barrier for citizens to submit an issue
* Collect early signals and real‑world problem statements
* Support collaboration, discussion, and contributor onboarding

## 🧩 What This Repository Is (and Is Not)

### This repository **is**:

* A public‑facing website
* An explanation of Balungpisah’s purpose and principles
* A simple intake mechanism for citizen reports
* A collaboration space for content, UX, and accessibility work

### This repository **is not**:

* The Balungpisah core backend (`balungpisah-core`)
* The citizen monitoring application (`balungpisah-citizen-app`)
* The government reporting interface (`balungpisah-government-app`)
* A production‑grade reporting or moderation system

If you are looking to work on business logic, data processing, dashboards, or infrastructure, this is **not** the correct repository.
